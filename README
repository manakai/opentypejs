A variant of opentype.js
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a modified version of opentype.js.

See |doc/README.orig.md|, which is the |README.md| of the original
repository, for more information on the original version.

* Additional features

  - Added support for more table versions and/or fields: |base|,
    |cmap|, |gpos|, |os2|, |post|, |vhea|, |vmtx|.
  - Added accessors for more data in font files: |cmap|, |meta|, |name|.
  - Added tentative support for character encodings: Shift JIS and Big5.
    In the current implementation they are decoded as Encoding Standard's
    shift_jis and big5, which is not desired for OpenType font's decoding
    in fact.
  - Added support for generation of |cmap| subtable whose |format| is
    14 (Unicode Variation Sequences).  A variation sequence can be
    associated with a glyph /glyph/ by the |addVS| method:

      glyph.addVS (0x5922, 0xE0100);

  - Added support for generation of |cmap| subtable whose |format| is
    13.  A range of Unicode code points can be associated with a
    glyph /glyph/ by the |addUnicodeRange| method:

      glyph.addUnicodeRange (0x4E00, 0x9FFF);

  - Added suport for generation of custom |cmap|, |COLR|, |CPAL|,
    |GDEF|, |GPOS|, |GSUB|, and/or |name| subtables by specifying
    ArrayBuffer objects.  Usage:

      const font = new opentype.Font ({
        ...args,
        tables: {
          cmap: {
            arrayBufferList: [ab1, ab2, ab3, ...],
          },
        },
      });
