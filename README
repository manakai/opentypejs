A variant of opentype.js
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a modified version of opentype.js.

See |doc/README.orig.md|, which is the |README.md| of the original
repository, for more information on the original version.

* Additional features

  - Added support for more table versions and/or fields: |base|,
    |cmap|, |gpos|, |os2|, |post|, |vhea|, |vmtx|.
  - Added accessors for more data in font files: |cmap|, |meta|, |name|.
  - Added tentative support for character encodings: Shift JIS and Big5.
    In the current implementation they are decoded as Encoding Standard's
    shift_jis and big5, which is not desired for OpenType font's decoding
    in fact.
